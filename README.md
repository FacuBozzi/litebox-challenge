This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Architecture Notes

- The landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) is a Server Component (`"use client"` is absent) so it renders on the server.
- During that render the `Home` function invokes `fetch(`${process.env.LITE_TECH_API_HOST}/api/posts?limit=14`, { cache: "no-store" })`, pulling the latest posts on the server before hydrating the client.
- Because the data is loaded server-side, users see fresh content on first paint and we avoid exposing backend credentials to the browser.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
